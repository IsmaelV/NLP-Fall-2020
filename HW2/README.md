# Homework 2: Simple Lemmatizer
All of README file written by Ron Artstein unless otherwise noted (last section of README).
## Due date: Monday, 14 of September of 2020, at 23:59 (11:59PM) Pacific Time
This assignment counts for 5% of the course grade. Assignments turned in after the deadline but before Thursday, 
September 17 are subject to a 20% grade penalty.

### Overview
In this assignment you will write a very simple lemmatizer, which learns a lemmatization function from an annotated 
corpus. The function is so basic I wouldn't even consider it machine learning: it's basically just a big lookup table, 
which maps every word form attested in the training data to the most common lemma associated with that form. At test 
time, the program checks if a form is in the lookup table, and if so, it gives the associated lemma; if the form is not 
in the lookup table, it gives the form itself as the lemma (identity mapping).

The program performs training and testing in one run: it reads the training data, learns the lookup table and keeps it 
in memory, then reads the test data, runs the testing, and reports the results. The program output is in a fixed format, 
reporting 15 counters and 5 performance measures. The assignment will be graded based on the correctness of these 
measures.

### Data
A set of training and test data is available as a compressed ZIP archive on Blackboard. The uncompressed archive 
contains the following files:
* Three corpus files in universal dependencies format, with the file names indicating whether the file is for 
development, training, or testing (only the training and testing files will be used in the exercise).
* Additional readme and license files, which will not be used for the exercise.
The submission script will learn the model from the training data, test it on the test data, output the results, and 
compare them to the known solution. The grading script will do the same, but on training and test data from a different 
language.

### Program
You will write a program called `lookup-lemmatizer.py` in Python 3 (Python 2 has been deprecated), which will take the 
paths to the training and test data files as command-line arguments. Your program will be invoked in the following way:

> python lookup-lemmatizer.py /path/to/train/data /path/to/test/data

The program will read the training data, learn a lookup table, run the lemmatizer on the test data, and write its report 
to a file called lookup-output.txt. The report has a fixed format of 22 lines which looks as follows:
* Training statistics
* Wordform types: 16879
* Wordform tokens: 281057
* Unambiguous types: 16465
* Unambiguous tokens: 196204
* Ambiguous types: 414
* Ambiguous tokens: 84853
* Ambiguous most common tokens: 75667
* Identity tokens: 201485
* Expected lookup accuracy: 0.967316238343
* Expected identity accuracy: 0.716883052192
* Test results
* Total test items: 35430
* Found in lookup table: 33849
* Lookup match: 32596
* Lookup mismatch: 1253
* Not found in lookup table: 1581
* Identity match: 1227
* Identity mismatch: 354
* Lookup accuracy: 0.962982658276
* Identity accuracy: 0.776091081594
* Overall accuracy: 0.954642957945
The numbers above are a correct output when running the program on the supplied data (the submission script). There is 
some variability possible in the output; see note below. The numbers will be different when the program is run on the 
data used by the grading script.

Starter code is available on Blackboard, which already reads the input and formats the output correctly. You are 
strongly encouraged to use this starter code; you will need to write the code that performs the counts and calculates 
the results correctly.

### Submission
All submissions will be completed through [Vocareum](https://labs.vocareum.com/main/main.php); please consult the 
[instructions for how to use Vocareum.](http://ron.artstein.org/csci544-2020-08/Student-Help-Vocareum.pdf)

Multiple submissions are allowed; only the final submission will be graded. Each time you submit, a submission script is 
invoked, which runs the program on the test data. Do not include the data in your submission: the submission script 
reads the data from a central directory, not from your personal directory. You should only upload your program file to 
Vocareum, that is `lookup-lemmatizer.py`; if your program uses auxiliary files (for example, lists of common names), 
then you must also include these in your personal directory.

You are encouraged to submit early and often in order to iron out any problems, especially issues with the format of the 
final output.

_The output of your program will be graded automatically; failure to format your output correctly may result in very low 
scores, which will not be changed._

For full credit, make sure to submit your assignment well before the deadline. The time of submission recorded by the 
system is the time used for determining late penalties. If your submission is received late, whatever the reason 
(including equipment failure and network latencies or outages), it will incur a late penalty.

### Grading
After the due date, we will run your lemmatizer on training and test data from a different language, and compare the 
output of your program to a reference output for that language. Each of the 20 numbers calculated will count for 5% of 
the grade for the assignment.

### Note
Ties in the training data. The problem definition does not state what to do in case of ties in the training data, that 
is when for an ambiguous word form, there are two or more most common lemmas. In this case, either of the lemmas could 
enter the lookup table, which could cause a small amount of variation in the test data. This is expected, and the 
grading script will allow for this variation; for the supplied data (the submission script), the following is legitimate 
(correct) variation:

* Lookup match: 32589 to 32640
* Lookup mismatch: 1209 to 1260
* Lookup accuracy: 0.962775857485 to 0.964282548967
* Overall accuracy: 0.954445385267 to 0.955884843353
